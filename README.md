# Zstd WebAssembly build

This build is based on [facebook/zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) and provides a thin WebAssembly wrapper around the zstd.h API. Please see [index.html](https://kig.github.io/zstd-emscripten/) for a demo and usage example.

This is a size-optimized build (ZSTD_MINIFY_LIB and ZSTD_NO_INLINE build flags). The build output is three versions of the binding: full, compress-only, decompress-only. The brotli-compressed size of the wasm varies from 20 kB decompress-only to 70 kB full binding. There's no need for a separate JS file to use the WebAssembly library, so you save 10 kB on that.

This repo tracks the upstream as a submodule. 

The previous forked repo is [archived](https://github.com/kig/zstd-emscripten-archived/).

Thanks to Fredrick R. Brennan for their awesome work bringing the forked repo up-to-date with upstream Zstandard and fixing the CMake build files.

## Build

```bash
# Install LLVM 13 and wasm-opt
brew install llvm && export PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin &&
brew install binaryen &&

# Install zstd-emscripten repo and zstd upstream.
git clone https://github.com/kig/zstd-emscripten && cd zstd-emscripten && git checkout llvm-build && git submodule update --init &&

# Build
./llvm_build.sh &&

# List the built wasm files.
ls -l build/*.wasm &&

# Run a web server to check the test page.
serve -p 5000
# open http://localhost:5000/index.html
```

## Usage

See the [test page](index.html) for examples on using the simple API and the streaming compression and decompression API.

Zstd-emscripten is a 1:1 binding to the ZSTD API in [zstd.h](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/lib/zstd.h), please refer to the [ZSTD docs](http://facebook.github.io/zstd/zstd_manual.html) for further details.

The compress-only and decompress-only versions of the library bind just a few functions, see [exported_functions_compress.txt](exported_functions_compress.txt) and [exported_functions_decompress.txt](exported_functions_decompress.txt) for the exported function lists. The full version function list is in [exported_functions.txt](exported_functions.txt).
